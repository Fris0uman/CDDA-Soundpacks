    steps done
    explosions done
    melee done
    gunshots done
    hurt done
    misc/flashbang done
    engines todo
    doors todo
    misc/prying todo
  have sound available for the majority of situations (unique need not apply)

later:
  get music

notes:
  some stepping sounds have multi-second empty endings. nothing big but should maybe be trimmed
  alarm_loop isn't perfect; i had enough after listening to it for about 3-5 minutes
