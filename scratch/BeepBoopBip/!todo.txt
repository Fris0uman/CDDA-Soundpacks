trim excess silent data off
  a script to do this would be best
  this would also allow for more flexibility to get around a bfxr mixer limitation
    (sounds cannot start before playback, even when silent e.g., for reversed sounds)
encode .ogg's samplerate to 48000hz from .wav's
get music


notes:
  alarm_loop isn't perfect; i had enough after listening to it for about 3-5 minutes
